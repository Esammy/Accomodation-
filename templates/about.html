      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>For instance, you can say that multiplying c_t and f_t is a way to deliberately
        forget irrelevant information in the carry dataflow. Meanwhile, i_t and k_t provide
        information about the present, updating the carry track with new information.
        But at the end of the day, these interpretations don’t mean much, because what these
        operations actually do is determined by the contents of the weights parameterizing
        them; and the weights are learned in an end-to-end fashion, starting over with each
        training round, making it impossible to credit this or that operation with a specific
        purpose. The specification of an RNN cell (as just described) determines your hypothesis
        space—the space in which you’ll search for a good model configuration during
        training—but it doesn’t determine what the cell does; that is up to the cell weights.
        The same cell with different weights can be doing very different things. So the combination
        of operations making up an RNN cell is better interpreted as a set of constraints
        on your search, not as a design in an engineering sense.
        To a researcher, it seems that the choice of such constraints—</p>
